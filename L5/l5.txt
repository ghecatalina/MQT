Lab5: Kafka APIs: Producer-Consumer
1. Use SimpleExampleProducer.java class. Send an json file on topic events2. 
The modified file might be names JsonProducer.java. 

2. Use SimpleExampleProducer.java class or JsonProducer.java. 
Send a Java object as payload. 
The Java is the class 
public class Company {
    private String company;
    int tradeNumber;
    String registeredName;}
	
The file should be named CompanyProducer.java. 
In acest caz la dependencies se va adauga:    implementation 'io.confluent:kafka-json-serializer:7.5.1'
iar la 
repositories {
    maven {
        url "https://packages.confluent.io/maven"
    }
}

3. Create a Producer that uses an avro schema for Company class.
In main folder of the Producer project create avro folder.
Copy file AvroCompany.avsc into avro folder. 
NOTE:  If you create the avro folder in any other folder, but NOT in main, the sources will NOT be generated. 
In build.gradle file:
Add   id 'com.github.davidmc24.gradle.plugin.avro' version '1.9.1'   at plugins section
Add   implementation group: 'io.confluent', name: 'kafka-avro-serializer', version: '7.5.1'   at dependencies section
Gradle tab --> Producer --> Tasks -->  source generation --> generateAvroJava
right click -> play "Run Producer"
The AvroCompany.java will be generated into "build" folder.
build --> generated-main-avro-java folder

verify schema-registry server:
http://localhost:8081/   --> the port coresponds with the value from docker-compose.yml
http://localhost:8081/subjects
http://localhost:8081/schemas/ids/1 

4. Create a Consumer that uses an avro schema for Company class. 

Questions: 
1.Why is needed the class empty constructor?

For serialization and deserialization, the AvroCompany class normally needs an empty constructor. Classes must have a no-argument (empty) constructor in order for Avro to properly handle deserialization. By using the no-argument constructor, it must build an instance of the class in order to fill its fields with data from the serialized format.

2.Why are the Getters needed?

The data for a Company object is stored in the private fields of the AvroCompany class, which may be accessed via the getters in the class. They play a crucial role in data abstraction and encapsulation by enabling regulated and consistent access to the class's private fields.
